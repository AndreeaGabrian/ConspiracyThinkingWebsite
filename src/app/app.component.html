        <p>
          As QAnon grew beyond anonymous forums, ‚Äúbakers‚Äù and influencers shaped it around real-world events.
          Trump and his allies indirectly endorsed QAnon ideas at rallies, online, and even in official statements.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Key Moments:</strong><br>
          - Trump suggested using disinfectants like bleach against COVID-19 in 2020.<br>
          - QAnon spread false claims about Antifa starting wildfires during the West Coast wildfire season.

        <h3 class="htit">Misinformation & Public Impact</h3>
        <p>
          QAnon fueled misinformation during global crises, including the COVID-19 pandemic.
          Some followers promoted dangerous remedies like <strong>Miracle Mineral Solution</strong> (industrial bleach) as a cure.
        </p>
        <p>
          Trump helped amplify QAnon‚Äôs reach by <strong>retweeting over 70 QAnon-linked accounts</strong>, some later linked to <strong>Russian intelligence operations</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Massive Online Presence:</strong><br>
          - <strong>69M+ tweets</strong> referenced QAnon between 2017-2020.<br>
          - <strong>487K+ Facebook posts</strong> spread QAnon narratives.<br>
          - <strong>281K+ Instagram posts</strong> engaged with QAnon hashtags.

        <h3 class="htit">Meme Culture & Symbolism</h3>
        <p>
          QAnon thrived on <strong>Internet culture</strong>, using memes, in-jokes, and cryptic messages to engage followers.
          Many concepts were borrowed from <strong>films like <em>The Matrix</em> (1999) and <em>White Squall</em> (1996)</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Followers saw themselves as ‚Äúred-pilled,‚Äù referencing <em>The Matrix</em>, and urged others to <strong>‚ÄúFollow the White Rabbit‚Äù</strong>
          (<em>Alice in Wonderland</em> metaphor for discovering hidden truths).
        </p>
        <p>
          QAnon‚Äôs most famous slogan, <strong><em>‚ÄúWhere We Go One, We Go All‚Äù (WWG1WGA)</em></strong>, came from <em>White Squall</em>.

        As it became harder to ignore Q‚Äôs incompetency, followers started treating Q like a celebrity,

        memes, maps, and clocks‚Äîvisual tools that helped connect the community and justify their beliefs.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sight plays a crucial role in truth-making as well as fooling. The 1957 BBC broadcast on spaghetti farming
        deceived many viewers simply by showing a fake activity.
      </p>

    <h2 class="s-tit">From Conspiracy Thinking to Populist Narratives</h2>

    <p>
      While QAnon started as an online conspiracy movement, its core ideas‚Äîdistrust in elites,
      belief in hidden truths, and a battle between good and evil‚Äîalign closely with populist ideology.
    </p><br>

    <p>
      The movement gradually merged with <strong>far-right populism</strong>, reinforcing existing anti-government
      and anti-establishment sentiments. This transition <strong>turned conspiracy thinking into a political weapon</strong>,
      fueling division, misinformation, and radicalization.
    </p><br>

    <p>
      <strong>How does conspiracy thinking reinforce populism?</strong>
      The need for <strong>simple explanations</strong>, <strong>anger-driven beliefs</strong>, and <strong>blame attribution</strong> make
      conspiracy narratives a powerful tool for populist leaders, helping them rally support and
      justify extreme actions.

        <p>
          Populism is rooted in the belief in a <strong>good, homogenous, unified common people</strong> versus a <strong>corrupt elite</strong> that exploits them.
          This <strong>"us vs. them"</strong> mentality reinforces in-group identity and boosts the appeal of <strong>conspiracy theories</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Conspiracy thinking is associated with <strong>lower levels of analytical thinking</strong> and <strong>education</strong>. Populists often seek <strong>simple, binary explanations</strong> for complex issues.
